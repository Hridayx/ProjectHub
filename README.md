# ProjectHub – Community-Based Web Platform

ProjectHub is a student-focused web platform that connects programmers with real-world tech projects and active mentors, making it easier to learn by building rather than only studying theory. It gives students a dedicated space to discover projects, collaborate with peers, and showcase work as a portfolio.

## Why ProjectHub Helps Students

- **Discover real projects:** Explore AI, IoT, software, healthcare, and other domains instead of working on isolated toy problems.  
- **Build a strong portfolio:** Contribute to ongoing projects and use completed work in resumes, interviews, and internship applications.  
- **Learn with mentors:** Get guidance from mentors who review work, share feedback, and help shape project direction.  
- **Collaborate easily:** Team up with students from other branches or colleges to build larger, more impactful projects.  
- **Bridge to industry & research:** Use ProjectHub as a launchpad for research assistant roles, innovation teams, and hackathon collaborations.
